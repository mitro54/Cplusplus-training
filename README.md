# Cplusplus-training
- This repo is meant to act as a place where I can save my smaller learning projects to. 
- It is also meant to act as a semi-accurate representation of my learning journey in C++ and lower-level programming in general.
- This is a learning environment, meaning that the code found here is 100% of the time hand written.
